# My very own Minesweeper
This is still a work in progress.
### Requirements
- Qt (I use 5.15.17, but it's probably compatible with later versions)
- qmake (comes with Qt)
- A C++ compiler
### How to run it
1. Clone the repo
2. In the terminal, cd to the project directory and run:
```
qmake Minesweeper.pro
make
./Minesweeper 
```
